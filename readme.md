Introduction
===
 
Deep learning algorithm for Automatic Modulation Classification, this is an implement for [Deep Architectures for Modulation Recognition
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09197.pdf)

## Requirements 

* keras 1.2 with TensorFlow 1.0+ backend 
* a powerful GPU with large memory(if titan, batchsize is perfered for 1024, 512 for GTX1080)
